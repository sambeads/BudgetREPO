# budgetrepo
'''
The purpose of this repo is to help me manage my budget. Recognize that other tools may offer more functionality: this is to practice Python and to save me time in moving my credit card statement to my excel budget. 

Right now, I'm imagining a tool that pulls a number of Chase-generated excel sheets, takes relevant information, and inputs them into my formatting of Excel budget. It automatically opens when I run the commands. It is run from the CLI. I will take the output and copy it onto my files.

I am going to start with Chase Reserve then possibly both Chase formats.
